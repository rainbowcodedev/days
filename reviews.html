  <li class="bullet_text">Do you remember selling me that white Schwinn 10 speed way back when at a garage sale at your house? <br>
  If so, I would like to tell you how much that bike changed my life. I believe it was from the instant I got on it I knew it was for me and I actually<br>
loved riding that bike because it was so smooth and performed flawlessly. I have enjoyed riding since that day and usually hit the Prairie path in<br>
the western suburbs of Chicago. Have logged 1000's of miles since then averaging 400-700 a year recently on my mountain bike during the summer. <br>
Actually rented a bike in Steamboat Springs and rode Mt. Werner for a day. Almost died about 2 times. AWESOME time!!!!!!! Just a note from an old <br>
acquaintance that really truly appreciated your excellent skills and passion. - Tom</li>

  <li class="bullet_text">I'm glad to see this article as Doreen was very helpful years ago in locating a bike for me.  Recently I contacted her again and she was able to source<br>
a bike that I was looking for.  Refurbished to a &quot;T&quot; and I love it!  I would definately recommend you to anyone!  - Barbara Bitar</li>
  <li class="bullet_text">Doreen is a master at fixing things, whether it is on a bicycle or something at home.  She is always worth listening to when it comes to her fresh ideas!  <br>
