        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">There are about a billion bicycles in the world, twice as many as    motorcars. Almost 400 million<br>
bicycles are in China. Every year some 50    million bicycles – and 20 million cars – are produced.</li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">Although Leonardo da Vinci drew some rough sketches of a contraption    that looked like a bicycle, <br>
        the Frenchman De Sivrac built the first    bicycle-type vehicle in 1690. It was referred to as a hobbyhorse.<br>
However, it did not have pedals. Those were added in 1840 by a Scottish    blacksmith, Kirkpatrick <br>
Macmillan, who is credited with inventing the    real bicycle. </li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">On a penny-farthing bicycle, one pedal gave the wheel one turn. A lot    of pedaling was needed to get<br>
around! With the advent of gears,    bicycles could move as fast as cars.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">Air-filled tires were used on bicycles before they were used on  motorcars.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">The bicycle as we know it today – with two wheels of the same size –  looks almost exactly the same as <br>
        one from 1900. </li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">The first five-seat bicycle, the quindem, was built in 1940.<br>
        <br>
        </li>
        <li class="bigger_bullet_text">The world speed record on a bicycle is held by John Howard, Olympic    Cyclist and Ironman triathlon<br>
winner from the US. In 1985 he reached    152.2 mph (245,08 km/h), cycling in the slipstream of a specially    <br>
designed car.  [<a href="http://didyouknow.org/bicycles/">http://didyouknow.org/bicycles/</a>]</li>
