<h1>Full Circle: Loveland woman revisits her first business</h1>

  she is destined for entrepreneurship.</span></p>
<p class="body_text">Doreen Sobioch was proud of the day she got her first stack of Doreen's Bicycle Shop cards because <br>
  it made the business she started at age 11 official. Sobioch, 44, opened the second generation of her<br>
bicycle shop in April, called Days Roll By. The shop, [no longer at] 1905 W. Eight St., sells reconditioned <br>
bikes, accessories such as clothing and used bicycle parts.  She also does repairs and tune-ups.</p>
<p class="body_text">Sobioch's interest in bicycles started when she growing up in a &quot;tinkering&quot; family outside of Chicago. Her<br>
father, a tool and die machinist and maintenance engineer, was adept at fixing anything that broke down at the candy factory where he worked, <br>
Sobioch said. He tutored his mechanically inclined daughter on how to repair bikes.</p>
<p class="body_text">When she became good enough to work independently, she launched her business out of her parents' garage.  They made her pay a <br>
modest rent.  During the winter, she would fix up bicycles, and by the time the snow finally melted in the spring, she would have a garage<br>
full of bicycles ready for sale.</p>
<p class="body_text">&quot;I'd have about 35 bicycles ready to go on my driveway,&quot; Sobioch said. Through her bicycle shop, she saved enough money to pay for<br>
college where she studied business marketing and international relations.</p>
<p class="body_text">After college, she pursued other careers besides bicycle repair, but it was something she has kept up as a hobby. In April, Sobioch <br>
opened her own shop again.  Her career as a residential appraiser gives her the schedule flexibility to do both jobs. She even gets some<br>
of the bicycle inventory from home sales on bank-owned properties that she appraises.</p>
<p class="body_text">With the new store, she has been able to free up some space in her garage, which was full of bicycles.</p>
<p class="body_text">Sobioch's bicycles.</p>
<p class="body_text">Even with her love of bicycles, Sobioch has never owned a new one. This is partly because she loves personalizing and fixing them up <br>
and because of her parents' frugal influence.</p>
<p class="body_text">They were German immigrants who lived through World War II in Germany, who taught their three children to save and reuse everything. <br>
Sobioch carries on that legacy and does whatever she can to keep bicycles out of the landfill and get them back on the road, Sobioch said.</p>
<p class="body_text">A trend in her bicycle shop is making hybrids that use different components from different bikes to create easy-to-use models, like cruisers.</p>
<p class="body_text">&quot;People want something that's simple to ride and simple to maintain,&quot; she said.</p>
<p class="body_text">Sobioch's own bicycle is a hybrid.</p>
<p class="body_text">She rides a Schwinn mountain bike frame with mountain bike wheels and city-slick tires.  It is hand-painted a metallic purple, one of her<br>
favorite colors, complete with Schwinn decals.</p>
<p class="body_text">While she takes pleasure in fixing up many styles of bikes, she got to repair one of the most interesting models a few months ago. It <br>
was a 1946 Raleigh bike from England with a &quot;very artistic swoop frame,&quot; Sobioch said.</p>
<p class="body_text">Fred Snyder of Fort Collins found the bicycle for his wife at a garage sale and thought it was a reproduction.  He didn't know it was from the <br>
1940's and was surprised by all the information Sobioch found on it and how &quot;into it&quot; she was.</p>
<p class="body_text">&quot;This woman knows her stuff,&quot; Snyder said.  &quot;I was glad I took it to her.&quot; Sobioch reworked the bicycle after researching it online and is <br>
waiting to find just the right chrome fenders.</p>
<p class="body_text">When it was in her shop &quot;everyone wanted it,&quot; said Sobioch, who had to turn down many potential buyers.</p>
